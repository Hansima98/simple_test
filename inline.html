      ODL is especially useful for potential students who are unable to access
      learning opportunities where they are provided. For these students,
      learning opportunities need to be offered where they are located, and
      provided at a time which best suits them and their circumstances. ODL also
      offers students choices in relation to entry and exit points, as well as
      selection of courses, making it particularity suitable for lifelong-long
      learners who wish to continue with their education while in employment or
      engaged with domestic work.
